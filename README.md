I had some trouble with the Interval not stopping after using 'mousePressed.' I also wanted to add another canvas using 'doubleClicked,' however the same issue of the interval not stopping would happen. I'm still not sure what step I was missing with my earlier code, I had some errors when I would set the interval time too fast, but, I still managed to create a "Pollock" concept with the ellipse and line shapes with a simpler code. I also liked experimenting with the line lengths, and how they reacted changing the X and Y positions.
